# AI Receptionist for Doctor: 
This project is an AI-powered text-based receptionist system for a doctor, which assists in handling emergencies and messages. It uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify the type of query (emergency or message), fetch appropriate emergency responses from a vector database (FAISS), and manage conversation states using Streamlit.
